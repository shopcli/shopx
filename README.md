claude code... but for shopping!

## What is shopx?
A command-line shopping assistant that lets you buy stuff discreetly from your terminal. Type what you need in natural language, and shopx handles the rest.

## Setup

**Note:** This is a hacky project we built at a hackathon, so expect some rough edges!

### Prerequisites

1. Get an OpenRouter API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API key:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Installation & Running

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   node ./dist/cli/source/cli.js
   ```

enjoy shopping from your humble terminal (‚ó°‚óï‚èñ‚óï)·ëêüùê ‚†Å‚≠í*.‚ú©.*‚≠í‚†Å
